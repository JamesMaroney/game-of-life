game-of-life
============

Needed just a little fun exercise to get my mind right. 

What started out as a realtively simple exercise of implementing [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
quickly became a very fun experiment in building a Humans vs. Zombies simulator.

In this game, you can tweak lots of variables. Zombie and Human strength, strength boosts for each when crowds form, migration
tendencies, human reproduction probability, deaths due to overcrowiding, etc.
