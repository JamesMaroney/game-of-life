Game of Life ... and Zombies!
============

What started out as a realtively simple exercise of implementing [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
just to get my mind right quickly became a very fun experiment in building a Humans vs. Zombies simulator!

In this game, Humans kill Zombies and Zombies infect Humans. You can tweak lots of variables like Zombie and Human strength, 
strength boosts for each when crowds form, migration tendencies, human reproduction probability, deaths due to overcrowding, etc.

Unlike Conway's Game of Life, the rules aren't absolute. Pretty much everything is based on chance, and you get to tweak
the likelihood of certain outcomes. One thing I learned, though, is the Zombies pretty much always win!

Hope you have fun! [Play Game of Life ... and Zombies!](http://jamesmaroney.github.io/game-of-life)
